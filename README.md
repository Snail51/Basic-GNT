# Purpose
 This project creates a super simple browser-based GNT. It is **a thought experiment** based on things I learned in my classes at the University of Minnesota Duluth, during the time I was a student there. It is extremely rudimentary, and there are better ways to do it.

# Limitations
 As a **thought experiment**, this program is very limited in it's capabilities. It only has a token context of two; meaning that each generated word is based ONLY on the word immediately preceding it.

# Installation
 - This program can be run in any httpx environment capable of executing JavaScript.
 - A working version is **already available at:** https://tools.snailien.net/Basic-GNT/
